BayAreaBikeShareMaps is a web application that provides optimized directions to BayAreaBikeShare riders. The application uses Google Distance Matrix and Google Directions APIs to determine optimal routes to and from a BayAreaBikeShare station, and biking directions between two stations. The app also accounts for rides longer than 30 minutes by directing users to multiple check-in stations along their route.

## The site is currently, and will continue to be, Live at [www.BikeShareMaps.herokuapp.com](http://www.BikeShareMaps.herokuapp.com])
(version 1.0)

## BayAreaBikeShare Maps was forked from [DivvyMaps](http://divvymaps.com) and ported to work in San Francisco (Divvy was the Chicago branding of a similar bikeshare program).

### Please Feel free to comment or report any bugs by submitting an "issue" here on github. Thanks, and enjoy your ride!
